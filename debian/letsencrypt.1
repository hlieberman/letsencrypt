.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
The objective of Letâ€™s Encrypt and the ACME (Automated Certificate
Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible to set up an HTTPS
server and have it automatically obtain a browser-trusted certificate,
without any human intervention. This is accomplished by running the
\fBletsencrypt\fR certificate management agent on the web server.
